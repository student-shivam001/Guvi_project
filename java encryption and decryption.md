# Java Encryption and Decryption Program

This is a simple Java program that demonstrates encryption and decryption of messages using a key-value pair for each alphabet. It provides functionality to encrypt a message and decrypt an encrypted code back to the original message.

## Features

- **Encryption**: The program takes a user input message and encrypts it using a predefined key-value pair for each alphabet character. It converts each character of the message to its corresponding integer value.
- **Decryption**: The program allows the user to input an encrypted code and decrypts it back to the original message using the reverse mapping of the key-value pairs.
- **Customizable Key**: The key-value pairs for encryption and decryption can be customized according to specific requirements.
- **Input Validation**: The program handles input validation to ensure that only valid messages and encrypted codes are accepted.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Program**: Compile the Java program (`EncryptionDecryption.java`) using any Java compiler.

2. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled program to start the encryption and decryption process. Follow the instructions provided in the console.

3. **Input Message**: Enter the message that you want to encrypt. You can include any characters, including whitespace.

4. **Encrypted Code**: The program will generate an encrypted code based on the input message and display it to the user.

5. **Input Encrypted Code**: Enter the encrypted code when prompted by the program.

6. **Decrypted Message**: The program will decrypt the encrypted code and display the original message to the user.

## Key-Value Pairs

The encryption and decryption process relies on key-value pairs for each alphabet character. By default, the program provides the following key-value pairs:
